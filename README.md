# SafeRoomAI-Showcase 🛡️📹

**A smart surveillance and workplace behavior analytics platform.**
*SafeRoomAI*, a capstone project developed as part of the AIDI-2005-02 course at Durham College. The goal of the project is to design and build an AI-powered video surveillance system that processes live camera feeds for security and human resource management, using real-time detection, behavioral analytics, and interactive dashboards.

> 💡 Think of it as the "Stripe of AI-powered workplace surveillance and HR analytics."

## 🔍 Project Overview

**SafeRoomAI** is a modular, API-first platform that transforms raw surveillance video into structured, actionable intelligence in real time. It supports:

- **Motion and object detection** (e.g., detecting people, vehicles)

  </p>
- **Facial recognition and action classification** (e.g., loitering, entering restricted areas)

  </p>
- **Anomaly detection** (e.g., off-hour entry, irregular behavior)
